Rising bubble (2-phase)
=======================

This demo is implemented in a single Python file
:download:`demo_2phase-rising-bubble.py`.

A bubble consisting of one fluid is rising in the column of some heavier
fluid. Both fluids are incompressible and immiscible. The setting is
two-dimensional and isothermal. Incompressible CHNS model is used to simulate
the bubble dynamics.
